# Overview
This Repository contains functions to replicate @lw2008-sr and @lw2011-var.

Michael Wolf provides `R` codes for those two papers on 
[his webpage](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/wolf.html), 
in the 
[publications section](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/wolf/publications.html).

What is found here is merely an edit of those codes.

If you find any bug, or technical error, please contact me.

# PAPERS and GOALS of the code
On @lw2008, @lw2011, and @lw2018 the authors provide methods to test the hypothesis of difference in the Sharpe Ratio and the Variance of two investment strategies.
The papers can be found in the following links:

[SR Paper](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:ffffffff-935a-b0d6-0000-00007214c2bc/jef_2008pdf.pdf), 
[SR WP](http://www.econ.uzh.ch/static/wp_iew/iewwp320.pdf), 
[Variance Paper](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:520edf26-2322-4708-8dde-51d61141914a/Ledoit_et_al-2011-Wilmott_Robust_Performance.pdf), 
[Variance WP](http://www.econ.uzh.ch/static/wp_iew/iewwp516.pdf),
[Generalized WP](http://www.econ.uzh.ch/static/wp/econwp305.pdf).

# Functions

I copied the original functions on `Sharpe.RData` and `Var.RData` into the files: `"SR-ORIGINAL.R"` and `"Var-ORIGINAL.R"` with some minor modifications.
Then I copied the functions to the file `"LW-SR-Var.R"` and modified them more.

I didn't have enought time to modify the `block.size.calibrate()` functions.

# Data

For the data, I simpy saved the returns data of `Sharpe.RData` as a `.RDS` file.
Loading `rets.RDS` should result in a list object on the `R` Software [@R] .

# USAGE

See DEMO files.

# TODO
- Document Functions (R and html nb)

# DISCLAIMER

I own NONE of the rights to the codes.
I simply edited the already existing codes in
[Michael Wolf's Webpage](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/wolf.html).
I also offer NO support for the functions.
They are presented "AS IS".

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank Michael Wolf for providing the original functions on his webstite.
